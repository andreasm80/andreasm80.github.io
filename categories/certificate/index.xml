            This article will quickly go through how to create wildcard certificates and automatically renew them with Lets Encrypt and Cert-Manager
Cert-Manager cert-manager adds certificates and certificate issuers as resource types in Kubernetes clusters, and simplifies the process of obtaining, renewing and using those certificates.
It can issue certificates from a variety of supported sources, including Let&#39;s Encrypt, HashiCorp Vault, and Venafi as well as private PKI.
It will ensure certificates are valid and up to date, and attempt to renew certificates at a configured time before expiry.
