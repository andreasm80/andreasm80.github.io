            Hugo on Github: I have been running my blog page locally on Kubernetes for a long time now. And it has worked very well. But one always have to try something new, and I have always wanted to explore the option to host it on Github to have one maintenance task less to worry about. To get started with this I got some absolutely great help from my colleague Robert who put me into the right track to get this project rolling.
