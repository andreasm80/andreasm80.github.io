            Tanzu Kubernetes Grid This post will go through how to deploy TKG 2.1, the management cluster, a workload cluster (or two), and the necessary preparations to be done on the underlaying infrastructure to support TKG 2.1. In this post I will use vSphere 8 with vSAN, Avi LoadBalancer, and NSX. So what we want to end up with it something like this:
Preparations before deployment This post will assume the following:

            What is the NSX Antrea integration Assumptions: I assume that the reader is aware of what Antrea is, and what a CNI is and also what NSX is. If not head over here to read more on Antrea and here to read more on NSX.
For many years VMware NSX has help many customer secure their workload by using the NSX Distributed Firewall. As NSX has evolved over the years the different platform it supports has also broadened, from virtual machines, bare metal server, cloud workload and kubernetes pods.

      <title>Managing your Antrea K8s clusters running in VMC from your on-prem NSX Manager</title>

            This week I was fortunate to get hold of a VMC on AWS environment and wanted to test out the possibility of managing my K8s security policies from my on-prem NSX manager by utilizing the integration of Antrea in NSX. I haven&#39;t covered that specific integration part in a blog yet, but in short: by using Antrea as your CNI and you are running NSX-T 3.2 you can manage all your K8s policies from the NSX manager GUI.

            VMware NSX 3.2 is out and packed with new features. One of them is the NSX Application Platform which runs on Kubernetes to provide the NSX ATP (Advanced Threat Protection) functionality such as NSX Intelligence (covered in a previous post), NSX Network Detection and Response (NDR) and NSX Malware. This post will go through how to spin up a K8s cluster for this specific scenario covering the pre-reqs from start to finish.

            This post will go through the IDS/IPS built-in feature of the NSX distributed firewall.
Abbreviations used in this article:
IDS = Intrusion Detection System IPS = Intrusion Prevention System Introduction to VMware NSX distributed IDS &amp;amp; IPS Before we dive into how to configure and use the distributed IDS and IPS feature in NSX let me just go through the basics where I compare the traditional approach with IDS/IPS and the NSX distributed IDS/IPS.

      <title>Deploy NSX-T 2.4 Edge Nodes on a N-VDS Logical Switch</title>

            To be able to deploy an Edge node or nodes in your lab or other environment where you only have 2 physical nic you must be able to deploy it on a N-VDS switch as you have already migrated all your kernels etc to this one N-VDS switch.
But trying to do this from the NSX-T 2.4 manager GUI you will only have the option to deploy it to VSS or VDS portgroups, the N-VDS portgroups are not visible at all.

      <title>&#34;General Error&#34; NSX-T Manager Firewall Section</title>

            If you have missing objects in the firewall section before upgrading from NSX-T 2.1 to 2.2 you will experience a General Error in the GUI, on the Dashboard, and in the Firewall section of the GUI. You will even get general error when doing API calls to list the DFW sections https://NSXMGRIP/api/v1/firewall/sections: { &amp;quot;module\_name&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;common-services&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;error\_message&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;General error has occurred.&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;details&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;java.lang.NullPointerException&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;error\_code&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;100&amp;quot; }
If you have upgraded the fix is straight forward.
