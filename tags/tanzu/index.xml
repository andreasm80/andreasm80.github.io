            Tanzu Kubernetes Grid This post will go through how to deploy TKG 2.1, the management cluster, a workload cluster (or two), and the necessary preparations to be done on the underlaying infrastructure to support TKG 2.1. In this post I will use vSphere 8 with vSAN, Avi LoadBalancer, and NSX. So what we want to end up with it something like this:
Preparations before deployment This post will assume the following:

            Antrea Egress: What is Egress when we talk about Kubernetes? Well if a pod wants to communicate to the outside world, outside the Kubernetes cluster it runs in, out of the worker node the pod resides on, this is egress traffic (definition &amp;quot;the action of going out of or leaving a place&amp;quot; and in network terminology means the direction is outward from itself).
Why does egress matter? Well, usually when the pods communicate out, they will use the IP address of the worker node they currently is deployed on.

            Deploy Tanzu in vSphere 8 with VDS and Avi Loadbalancer: This post will go through how to install Tanzu in vSphere 8 using vSphere VDS networking and Avi as loadbalancer. The goal is to deploy Tanzu by using vSphere Distributed Switch (no NSX this time) and utilize Avi as loadbalancer for Supervisor and workload cluster L4 endpoint (kubernetes API). When that is done I will go through how we also can extend this into L7 (Ingress) by using AKO in our workload clusters.

            Deploy Tanzu in vSphere 8 with NSX and Avi Loadbalancer: This post will go through how to install Tanzu in vSphere 8 using NSX networking (including built in L4 loadbalancer) and Avi as L7 loadbalancer. The goal is to deploy Tanzu by using NSX for all networking needs, including the Kubernetes Api endpoint (L4) and utilize Avi as loadbalancer for all L7 (Ingress). The deployment of Tanzu with NSX is an automated process, but it does not include L7 loadbalancing.
