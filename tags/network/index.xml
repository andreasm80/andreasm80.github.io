            Tanzu with vSphere using NSX with multiple T0s In this post I will go through how to configure Tanzu with different T0 routers in NSX for separation and network isolation. The first part will involve spinning up dedicated NSX Tier-0s by utlizing several NSX Edges and NSX Edge Clusters. The second part will involve using NSX VRF. Same needs, two different approaches, and some different configs in NSX. In vSphere with Tanzu with NSX we have the option to override network setting pr vSphere Namespace.

            Deploy Tanzu in vSphere 8 with NSX and Avi Loadbalancer: This post will go through how to install Tanzu in vSphere 8 using NSX networking (including built in L4 loadbalancer) and Avi as L7 loadbalancer. The goal is to deploy Tanzu by using NSX for all networking needs, including the Kubernetes Api endpoint (L4) and utilize Avi as loadbalancer for all L7 (Ingress). The deployment of Tanzu with NSX is an automated process, but it does not include L7 loadbalancing.
